2. Create your application (bot) on the [Discord site](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and invite it to your server.
3. Copy your bot token (from the Discord site in step 2) and paste it into the `config.json` file.
4. Go to the bot folder, then hold down the "Shift" key and "right-click" on the empty space inside the folder and select `open command window here` or `open PowerShell window here` (you can also reach the bot folder using cmd and `cd` command).
5. In the window that opens, type this text and press enter: `node index.js`
6. If the message `Ready!` is displayed, your bot is successfully online and usable.
